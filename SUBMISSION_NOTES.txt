Submission Notes
----------------

I wrote the whole assignment in Haskell (after asking for permission).

Haskell's OpenGL binding is a direct mapping to the underlying C library,
which is why my code is almost a line-by-line translation of the equivalent
C code.

In addition to the required tasks I added a small command-line parser and the possibility to rotate the face using the keyboard and the mouse (click-and-drag). The view can be scrolled with the mouse wheel.

I wrote a full Haskell library to read PPM files and publshed it on Hackage:

    http://hackage.haskell.org/package/netpbm
    https://github.com/nh2/haskell-netpbm

Therefore my PPM parsing code is not included in the submission; it depends on it using Haskell's package database.


Running my code
---------------

You can compile and run the code with:

    cabal install --only dependencies
    cabal configure
    cabal build
    ./dist/build/coursework/coursework /PATH/TO/face.vtk /PATH/TO/face.ppm

or alternatively by installing the dependencies in the cabal file manually and running

    ghc --make -O2 Coursework.hs
    ./Coursework

If you have problems compiling it, I am glad to do it for you or demo my code in labs.

I also put a runnable binary into

    /homes/nh910/public_html/graphics-coursework-face /homes/nh910/public_html/face.vtk /homes/nh910/public_html/face.ppm

Thanks for this task, it was fun!
